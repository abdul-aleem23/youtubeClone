This project is a clone of the YouTube home page, built using HTML and CSS. Through the creation of this project, I learned about the nested layout technique, how to use grids and flexboxes for layout, the different display properties in CSS, and how to make a website responsive. I also gained a deeper understanding of CSS positioning, including absolute positioning. This project allowed me to practice and improve my web development skills and create a visually similar replica of the YouTube home page.
